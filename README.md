# Modul 295 LBB Task API

In this repository lies the LBB (exam) for Module 295 of ZLI (Zürcher Lehrbetriebsverband ICT).

The task was to create a Rest-API that handles Tasks. You can find the full API documentation under the endpoint `/swagger-ui` once you've set up the server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have read the README.md documentation
* You have installed the latest version of node and npm
* You have a working Browser
* (Optional) You have Postman or any other tool to check if the Endpoints work as expected

## Installing Task API

To install Task API, follow these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/TihanMo/m295_lbb.git
```

```
cd path/to/file/m295_lbb
```

```
npm install
```

## Using Task API

To use Task API, follow these steps:

```
npm run start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/swagger-ui` in your browser to see the documentation on all endpoints

## Testing

For Testing a Postman collection is provided to use it, follow these steps:

* Import m295_lbb.postman_collection.json into Postman
* Run the collection
* Note that the collection can **only be run once** with all checks passed because of unique IDs being created everytime you create a new task. If you want to test again you can manually input an object with following format:  
  {
    "id": "3b6b5d99-cc0b-4369-9f0c-df2145ac97f3",  
    "Titel": "New Task",  
    "Beschreibung": "This is a new task",  
    "Erstellungsdatum": "2023-06-10",  
    "Erfüllungsdatum": "2023-06-15"
  }

## Additional Scripts

```
npm run lint
npm run swagger:generate
```
